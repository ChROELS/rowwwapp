# rowwwapp - work in progress
Personal project since the end of my formation in Java EE Developement 2019-2020 at Intec Brussel.

What is it? A tool to help someone with a specific role, a member of a rowing club, to edit infos sheets about rowing competition or to gather infos to inscribe rowers to races.

Main features: H2 database on file, form templates, some data automatically determined based on other data, basic authentification, exportation to .csv and .xlsx.

Tools: IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code. 

It was created from several requirements from a 'true-false client' to learn to design this mvc app from A to Z. I have also learned to use SpringBoot thanks to this project.
