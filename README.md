# rowwwapp - work in progress
Personal project since the end of my formation in Java EE Developement at Intec Brussel
What is it? A tool to help people to edit infos sheet about rowing competition or to gather infos to inscribe rowers to races
Main features: H2 database on file, form templates, some data automatically determined based on other data, basic authentification, exportation to .csv and .xlsx
Tools: IntelliJ, SpringBoot 
It was created from several requirements from a 'real-false client' to learn to design the app from A to Z
